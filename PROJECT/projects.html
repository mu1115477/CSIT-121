            <p>Reflection: Lab 01 taught me how to organize web pages effectively using headers, navigation menus, and footers. I also learned how to style my pages using CSS, keeping my code clean and consistent across multiple pages. Understanding hyperlinks helped me navigate between different sections of my website seamlessly.</p>

            <p>Reflection: Lab 02 helped me improve my web programming abilities by introducing forms and input components, which enabled me to collect user data quickly. Understanding how to check user input enabled me to improve data accuracy and the overall user experience on my website. In addition, using CSS to style and structure form components increased the visual appeal and usefulness of my online forms.</p>

            <p>Reflection: Lab 03 focuses on how to successfully include photos into our website. I used the 'img' element to show a single picture with relevant accessibility features for better usability. In addition, I used CSS to display another picture, proving skill in other techniques of image presentation. This project underlined the significance of accessibility while also providing hands-on experience with image integration in HTML and CSS.</p>

            <p>Reflection: During the page layout lab, I received practical expertise in creating visually appealing and user-friendly web page layouts. I experimented with CSS features like margin, padding, and alignment to create design balance and consistency. In addition, I learned how to use media queries to incorporate responsive design concepts and assure compatibility across multiple screen sizes and devices. Collaborating with peers gave great ideas and created a collaborative learning environment, which improved my grasp of web design principles and approaches.</p>
