            <p>For the hands-on sample exercise, I experimented with CSS styles to change the look and color of text on a small webpage. I used inline styles to change the font family, size, and color of paragraphs, resulting in a visually unique layout. In addition, I provided HTML connections to other HTML and web development tools so that you could practice connecting within your webpage. This assignment gave excellent practice for applying CSS styles and inserting links into HTML text.</p>

            <a href="file:///Users/fatimamuhammadi/Downloads/Class%20121/Practice/prac.html">Evaluation</a>
            <p>This Web Design Evaluation provided insight into the structure and features of the UMBC website, which is essential for understanding its operation and audience appeal. Analyzing its design principles, such as CRAP (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity), highlighted the significance of visual structure and user interaction. The navigation design review emphasized the need for intuitive layout for a smooth user experience. Identifying prospective changes, such as material updates and feedback systems, exemplified a student-centered approach to increasing website effectiveness. Overall, this project helped me better grasp web design concepts and how to use them in practice while building user-friendly interfaces.</p>
